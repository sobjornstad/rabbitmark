Refactor/Bugfix:
    * Clean up where committing and flushing is done
    * Properly cancel the link crawl (currently, it keeps going in the background and you can't quit the app until it finishes)

Implement:
    * New/Open (?). At any rate don't hard-code the database file
    * Help menu options (fix links)
    * WBM auto-save and fallback field

Possible ideas:
    * CLI interface
    * Frequency of tags; "Hapax legomena last" option
    * TiddlyWiki syncing
    * Pocket syncing (one-way, but both pulling from Pocket and sending a link to Pocket)
    * Import/export could be improved


Manual database upgrade steps:
    - Dump the old DB:
      sqlite3 sorenmarks-test.db_ .dump >dump.txt
    - Remove CREATE TABLE and constraints
    - Edit the bookmark insert statements to show the set of columns (not including tags) we're adding
    - Add blanket UPDATE statements to fill default values in for the new columns
    - Create fresh database by moving the file away and restarting RabbitMark
    - Import into the new database:
      sqlite3 sorenmarks-test.db <dump.txt
