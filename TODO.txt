* "Hapax legomena last" option in Tags menu
* Don't jump the cursor around when focus is lost.
* Add a thingy to check if archive.org URL is *already* used, and if so to
  strip out the non-archive.org part and/or do a new snapshot search.
* Adding new with tags selected and not (no tags) doesn't work as expected
* "Pinned" flag (put at top of display)
* Add an option to select the tags that the current bookmark has?
* Add some sort of inter-item linkage function.
* Don’t reset the sort order when repopulating the bookmarks pane (this is a long-outstanding bug I’d never even noticed); updateForSearch() actually just does a sort by col 0!
