Bugfixes:
    * Properly cancel the link crawl (currently, it keeps going in the background and you can't quit the app until it finishes)

Refactor:
    * Clean up where committing and flushing is done

Implement:
    * Have a way to actually log in to Pocket, rather than having to manually run the OAuth flow and add the key in the database
    * Help menu options (fix links)

Possible ideas:
    * Allow items in the Skip column of the Pocket import to be viewed in the preview pane.
    * Allow editing items while importing from Pocket.
    * CLI interface
    * Frequency of tags; "Hapax legomena last" option
    * Sync with TiddlyWiki (ideally bidirectionally?)
    * Import/export could be improved
    * Duplicate finding tool
    * Save note that WBM snapshot has been taken to database?
    * Option to automatically snapshot a site in the WBM when bookmarking it


--------

- [ ] RabbitMark: Save Page Now API (in #Pending()
- [ ] Python library that syncs things into TiddlyWiki

## Bugs

- [ ] Clear the search box upon adding an item so that the new item shows up.
- [ ] Adding new with tags selected and not (no tags) doesn't work as expected
- [ ] Don't jump the cursor around when focus is lost.

## Refactor

- [ ] General refactoring (combine with other tasks as possible)

## Features

- [ ] Add a thingy to check if archive.org URL is *already* used, and if so to strip out the non-archive.org part and/or do a new snapshot search.
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation for tags
- [ ] "Hapax legomena last" option in Tags menu
- [ ] "Pinned" flag (put at top of display)
- [ ] Add an option to select the tags that the current bookmark has?
- [ ] Add some sort of inter-item linkage function.
- [ ] Don’t reset the sort order when repopulating the bookmarks pane (this is a long-outstanding bug I’d never even noticed); updateForSearch() actually just does a sort by col 0!
- [ ] Show number of occurrences of each tag
