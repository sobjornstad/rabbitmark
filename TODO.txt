Refactor/Bugfix:
    * Clean up where committing and flushing is done
    * Don't jump the cursor around when focus is lost.
    * Force name uniqueness in tags and marks
    * Properly cancel the link crawl (currently, it keeps going in the background and you can't quit the app until it finishes)

Implement:
    * New/Open (?). At any rate don't hard-code the database file
    * Import/Export functions
    * Help menu options
    * Flag to skip link check
    * WBM auto-save and fallback field

Possible ideas:
    * CLI interface
    * Frequency of tags; "Hapax legomena last" option
