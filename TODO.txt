## Bugs

- [ ] Don’t reset the sort order when repopulating the bookmarks pane (this is a long-outstanding bug I’d never even noticed); updateForSearch() actually just does a sort by col 0!
- [ ] Clear the search box upon adding an item so that the new item shows up
- [ ] Adding new with tags selected and not (no tags) doesn't work as expected
- [ ] Don't jump the cursor around when focus is lost
- [ ] Properly cancel the link crawl (currently, it keeps going in the background and you can't quit the app until it finishes)
- [ ] Help menu options (fix links)


## Refactor

- [ ] Remove Pocket integration, as Pocket does not exist anymore
- [ ] Clean up where committing and flushing is done
- [ ] General refactoring (combine with other tasks as possible)


## Features (probably do)

- [ ] Add a check to determine if archive.org URL is *already* used, and if so to strip out the non-archive.org part and/or do a new snapshot search.
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation for tags
- [ ] Show number of occurrences of each tag


## Features (possible)

- [ ] Save Page Now API (see correspondence with WayBackMachine)
- [ ] "Pinned" flag (put at top of display)
- [ ] Add an option to select the tags that the current bookmark has
- [ ] Add some sort of inter-item linkage function
- [ ] Python library that syncs things into TiddlyWiki
- [ ] Allow items in the Skip column of the Pocket import to be viewed in the preview pane.
- [ ] CLI interface
- [ ] Sync with TiddlyWiki (ideally bidirectionally?)
- [ ] Import/export could be improved
- [ ] Duplicate finding tool
- [ ] Save note that WBM snapshot has been taken to database?
- [ ] Option to automatically snapshot a site in the WBM when bookmarking it
- [ ] "Hapax legomena last" option in Tags menu
