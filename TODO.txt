Bugfixes:
    * Properly cancel the link crawl (currently, it keeps going in the background and you can't quit the app until it finishes)

Refactor:
    * Clean up where committing and flushing is done

Implement:
    * Have a way to actually log in to Pocket, rather than having to manually run the OAuth flow and add the key in the database
    * Help menu options (fix links)

Possible ideas:
    * Allow items in the Skip column of the Pocket import to be viewed in the preview pane.
    * Allow editing items while importing from Pocket.
    * CLI interface
    * Frequency of tags; "Hapax legomena last" option
    * Sync with TiddlyWiki (ideally bidirectionally?)
    * Import/export could be improved
    * Duplicate finding tool
    * Save note that WBM snapshot has been taken to database?
    * Option to automatically snapshot a site in the WBM when bookmarking it
